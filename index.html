                    <p>The flight to Tanzania took 18 hours, and the flight back took almost 24. We made stops in New York, Amsterdam, and Georgia. It was a long flight, but we got lots of sleep.</p>

                    <p>The students worked very hard to build a school in Imbaseni Village. Mixing cement was much harder than it looked, but the students were determined to get the work done.</p>

                    <p>Before our group left the school, they had filled half of the veranda with cement as well as one room. Other students from our school finished the entire veranda!</p>

                    <p>Students also built desks from pre-cut wood. They struggled to hammer the nails, but eventually were able to successfully finish. They had to make sure that there were no nails sticking out that could hurt the kids.</p>

                    <p>The windows needed to be chiseled so that they could fit the entire window frame. Students knocked them out with hammers and machetes. Eventually, they put the window frames in and used cement to keep them in place.</p>

                    <p>We also worked with local families in Imbaseni Village to build a goatshed. Students worked with wood that they needed to saw themselves and then nail together.</p>

                    <p>After working with the family that we built a goatshed for, we got to trek the bottom of Mount Meru. </p>

                    <p>Students enjoyed trekking the mountain, but were challenged by steep rocks and trails.</p>

                    <p>At the end of our trek, we got to stand under a beautiful waterfall. This made the challenging trek worth the trip.</p>

                    <p>At the end of the trip, we were able to go on an amazing safari. Here is a babboon troop walking along the path.</p>

                    <p>We saw so many elephants along our journey. An interesting fact about elephants is that they are a matriarchy, and all grown elephants in a herd are female.</p>

                    <p>We were worried we would not be able to see lions, but they we got word that there were lions in the area. We were able to see them in their natural habitat. Lions only eat every 3 days.</p>
